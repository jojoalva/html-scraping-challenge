# html_scraping_challenge

This challenge is going to achieve the following two deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Instructions for use:

    1. Ensure you have pandas, matplotlib, splinter and bs4 libraries downloaded into your anaconda environment.
    2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook downloaded into your anaconda environment.
    3. Download the two .ipynb files in this repository, and save them in a location on your local drive.
    4. Open Jupyter Notebook in this location and open the first file called 'part_1_mars_news'.
    5. Run each cell in succession - you will then be able to see the data you require, which should be all the titles and preview text from the website above.
    5. Do not close Jupyter Notebook as you will need it for the next task below!

    6. With Jupyter Notebook open, navigate to the first folder and find the 2nd notebook called 'part_2_mars_weather'.
    7. Run each cell in succession - you will then be able to see the data you require, which should be the analysis of all the Mars weather data. The penultimate cell will create a csv file from the dataframe you have just created. This .csv file will be found in the same location that your notebooks you have saved earlier.
